*Approximation_by_MC.Rmd* is a report for recording the process of approximating the distribution function of standard normal by the Monte Carlo method.

Because no line breaks are allowed inside chunk options but there are too many comments, so HTML version was uploaded for the sake of making the report pleasing to the eye.
